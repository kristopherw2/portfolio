                <p>I am a student in the Web Development Track at Thinkful. I love coding because not only do I enjoy
                    the thrill of solving problems, but it can be a source of creative expression. I enjoy building
                    applications to entertain or help someone make life easier. I am always open to learning new
                    libraries or frameworks and taking on new challenges.

                    Outside of coding, I enjoy doing various things. Such as training in Olympic and Strongman lifting,
                    fishing and you can find me in the Forgotten Realms at least once a week as I get into a campaign
                    of D&D.</p>

            <p class="project-font-color">This project was my first web application I built. Itâ€™s used to test general
                knowledge of sumo wrestling. I found a love for the sumo sport and noticed how little people knew about
                it and decided to develop an app to help alleviate that.</p>

        <p class="project-font-color">This is my Sunrise-Sunset project. The purpose for this project was to inform the user of how long their day will be for outdoor activities by giving them the time the sun will rise and set. I was inpired to do this because of my hobby for fishing and knowing these times help pick the perfect times for fishing! This was my first project with a team member. I organized and wrote most the code making the API request and interactivity of the application.</p>
